Frontend Technical Test for [TeamITG](https://teamitg.com/)

## Updated System requirements

Youâ€™ll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started with the test:

-   **Node 14+:** The current LTS (long-term support) release. We like to use a [Node Version Manager like NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
-   **NPM 6+ or Yarn:** Both of these package managers have ups and downs, choose whichever you prefer. Follow the installation instructions for Yarn or NPM to make sure you're using the latest version.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Type the following command to install the dependencies and run the project

```
npm install && npm start
```

## Solution description

-   Fixed broken source maps
-   Added styled components instead of sass
-   Added styled-system
-   Added basic styled-system framework

Basically, there are a lot of things I would love to fix, improve and add. Unfortunately could not spend more timeon it and will be glad to discuss it on an interview

-   Typescript
